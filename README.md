# pyOPAM
pyOPAM code from Baxter et al. (2022). Provides a computational method for estimating the pressure at which a basaltic liquid is co-saturated in olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene (OPAM parameterisation from Yang et al., 1996). An example input file is provided. Please refer to the simple instruction manual associated with the paper.
