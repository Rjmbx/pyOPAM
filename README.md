# pyOPAM
pyOPAM code from Baxter et al. (2022). Provides a computational method for estimating the pressure at which a basaltic liquid is co-saturated in olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene (OPAM parameterisation from Yang et al., 1996). An example input file is provided. Please refer to the simple instruction manual associated with the paper. Easy links to working Binder and Colab are provided by the badges above - click to access the links.
The stand-alone barometry code as described in the instruction manual is found in "OPAM_barometer.ipynb". Additional calculations provided in the paper can be found in "Appendix 1, pyOPAM test.ipynb" for the test of the experimental dataset and "Iceland pyOPAM.ipynb" for calculation of depths and relationships with magma fluxes for the Icelandic dataset.
